## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, Gulp.

## Personal Learnings
This project was my introduction to SASS where I learnt how to use variables, mixins and nesting, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also learnt how to use API's effectively, as well as practicing grid and flex. My JavaScript skills were also developed during this project, as I learnt how to use JavaScript to limit data results.
